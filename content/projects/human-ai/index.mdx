### Development of interactive artificial intelligence decision systems that understands the context of specific domains based on Neuro-Symbolic AI

- Project Start Date: Oct. 1, 2023
- Project End Date: Nov. 30, 2026

This project is part of the Horizon Europe Framework Programme and focuses on enhancing data processing efficiency in the cognitive computing continuum through AI-driven solutions for resource adaptation, strategic decision-making, and intent-based data operations. SNU plays a key role in developing neuro-symbolic AI technologies, knowledge databases, and interactive AI decision-making systems.

The objective is to develop a neuro-symbolic AI-based conversational artificial intelligence decision-making system equipped with the ability to understand and operate domain-specific knowledge.

#### Goals:
1. Build diverse domain-specific knowledge databases for various fields.
2. Develop composite reasoning technology based on neuro-symbolic AI.
3. Achieve conversational AI knowledge learning capabilities.
4. Design a method to link ontologies with domain-specific knowledge graphs.
5. Implement a code-switching mechanism to automatically switch between domain-specific knowledge databases based on the context of decision-making.

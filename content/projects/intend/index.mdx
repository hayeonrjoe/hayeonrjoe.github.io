### INTEND: Intent-Based Data Operation in the Computing Continuum

- Project Start Date: Jan. 1, 2024
- Project End Date: Dec. 31, 2027

The overall objective of INTEND is to deliver breakthrough AI solutions to achieve novel intentbased data operation, capable of (1) continually learning how to adapt heterogeneous cloud/edge resources, (2) strategic decision making across the decentralized continuum, and (3) human-friendly interaction with data stakeholders based on shared intents.

### inSwitch

The Biomedical Knowledge Engineering Laboratory (BiKE Lab) from Seoul National University (SNU) is headed by Professor Hong-Gee Kim and is responsible for inSwitch, one of the 11 software tools that will be delivered by the INTEND project. BiKE Lab will be collaborating together with Professor Taehyeong Kim and his laboratory, the Lab of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data for Agriculture (LABA) for the development of the tool. inSwitch is part of Work Package 4 (WP4), which is responsible for chat-based stakeholder interfaces for intent-based data operations. WP4 consists of 3 other software tools, inGraph, inChat and inExplain (inGen) and the 4 tools work together to form the stakeholder interfaces. In the WP4 group of tools, inSwitchâ€™s main role is to assist in translating natural language intents into structured languages that other INTEND tools and use cases can utilize.

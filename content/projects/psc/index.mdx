### Single-cell multi-omics based AI platform for discovering biomarkers and therapeutic targets

- Project Start Date: Jul. 1, 2023
- Project End Date: Jun. 30, 2026

The objective is to develop an AI platform for identifying diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) based on single-cell multi-omics.

#### Goals:
1. Generate and post-process single-cell multi-omics data for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC).
2. Develop a multi-AI platform to identify diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for PSC.
3. Create a service to explore PSC diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets using the AI platform.
